# AI4I Predictive Maintenance Machine Learning System
## 🚀 Overview

This project is an end-to-end Predictive Maintenance Machine Learning System built using the AI4I 2020 Industrial Dataset.
The system predicts whether a machine is likely to fail based on sensor readings such as:

Air temperature

Process temperature

Rotational speed (RPM)

Torque

Tool wear

Machine type (L, M, H)

The project includes:

Data cleaning

Feature engineering

Model training

Model evaluation

Explainability

FULL web application deployment using Streamlit
